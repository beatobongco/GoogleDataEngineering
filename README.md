## Google Cloud Platform Big Data and Machine Learning Fundamentals

Compute and storage - foundational requirements for computing

Elastic cloud
* current iteration of how we do computing - "third wave managed service"
* pay for what you use
* unlike creating and managing VMs yourself, use emphemeral resources to run jobs

Why do it this way?
* access to innovation and infrastructure of big players like Google at a pay-per-use basis
* leverage enormous amounts of compute in a short time without owning machines and justifying annual cost and depreciation 
(simply good economics)

Why use cloud services?
* change where you compute - dont need to manage your infrastructure (No Ops)
* improve scalability and reliability - use Google's infra
* change how you compute - leverage better tech/algorithms to do things that were not possible before. New "powers" if used
correctly can result in transformational innovation in your own business
